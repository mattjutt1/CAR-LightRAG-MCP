"""
Features package for the CAR/MCP server.

This package contains vertical slices, each representing a distinct
business capability or feature set of the application.
"""

# This __init__.py can be used to make it easier to import services
# from different feature slices, or can be left empty if direct
# imports to sub-packages are preferred.

# Example:
# from .knowledge_graph_entities.services import EntityService
# from .document_processing.processor_service import DocumentProcessorService # Assuming class name

# __all__ = [
#     'EntityService',
#     'DocumentProcessorService',
#     # ... other services
# ]
